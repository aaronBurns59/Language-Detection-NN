# Language-Detection-NN
A language detection neural network that will; parse text into n-grams, hash and store said n-grams in a vector and feed the indices of the vector into a neural netork, in order to determine a language

## 1 n-grams Parseing

## 2. Hashing n-grams

## 3. Feeding Neural Network with 

## 4. Detecting a Language with the Neural Network
